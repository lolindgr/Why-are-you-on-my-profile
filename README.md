# Greetings?

If you've reached this repository, that probabl means you're checking my profile. What motives could you be having for such actions? Isn't that some kind of weird and creepy stalker shit?

Do ou need me to point you towards the exit of this repository? Well, the steps are quite simple, really. All you need to do is press ALT + F4 on windows, CTRL + ALT + K on Linux or Command + Option + Control + Power_button on MacOS. :)
